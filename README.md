Abstract: 0-1 knapsack problem is one of the most common combinational 
optimisation problems, which intends toward maximising the profits of a 
selected subset of items with considering not to exceed a certain capacity. This 
paper proposes an improved discreet Jaya (IDJaya) algorithm to solve 0-1 
knapsack problems. IDJaya includes opposition-based learning (OBL), Jaya 
algorithm, transfer functions, mutation operator, repair method, and fitness 
function. OBL used to improve the initial population diversity, and mutation 
used to improve the search capabilities to overcome the problem of local 
optima. Transfer functions used to convert the continuous version of Jaya to a 
binary one. Repair method used to fix the infeasible solutions. Fitness function 
used to evaluate each solution. The performance of IDJaya is evaluated over a 
set of benchmark knapsack problems, and the results showed that IDJaya can 
be an efficient alternative approach for solving various 0-1 knapsack problems.
